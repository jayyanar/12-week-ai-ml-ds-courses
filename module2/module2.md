# Module 2 - Deep Learning: Computer Vision and NLP

## Overview
This module focuses on deep learning concepts, with an emphasis on computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Students will learn to build, train, and apply neural networks, including advanced deep learning techniques. All assignments will be completed using Google Colab, and students will work in teams (max of 3) to develop solutions and present them on the final Friday of the module week. Reference links and reading materials will be provided for all topics.

## Exercise Ideas for Module 2

1. **Understanding Deep Learning Applications**: Research a real-world application of deep learning in computer vision or NLP. Prepare a short presentation on how deep learning is used in that application and discuss the impact of this technology.

2. **Build and Train Neural Networks**: Using Google Colab, implement a shallow neural network for a basic classification task (e.g., MNIST dataset). Then, extend this to a deeper network and compare the performance metrics such as accuracy and training time.

3. **Experiment with Optimization Techniques**: Implement various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop on a given dataset using TensorFlow. Plot the loss curves and analyze how each algorithm affects the convergence rate and model accuracy.

**Note:** All assignments will be completed using Google Colab. Teams will present their solutions on the final Friday of the module week.
