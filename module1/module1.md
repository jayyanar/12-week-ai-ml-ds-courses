Week 1: Data Engineering
Day	Topics Covered	Key Takeaways
Day 1	Introduction to Data Engineering and Data Formats	Understand different data formats and their appropriate source systems.
Day 2	Relational vs NoSQL Databases	Learn the differences between relational and NoSQL databases.
Day 3	ACID Principles and Database Operations	Understand ACID compliance, CRUD operations, and troubleshoot database connection errors.
